                <p>The culinari art of the food trunk vendor has been steadily
                    improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from
                    Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai.

                <p>Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare
                    and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the
                    convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you
                    don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a
                    master chef at serveral fine establishment on the East Coast,
                    Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dinning to thw
                    Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.</p>
